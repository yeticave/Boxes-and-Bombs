## How to Play

Upon starting a game, the player is presented with a grid of boxes. Revealing a
box will either leave behind an empty spot or a number ranging from 1 to 6. The
number indicates how many bombs can be found around that particular field. Bombs
in diagonal directions are not counted.

The game is won when all boxes are either revealed or marked and lost when a
bombed box is revealed.
